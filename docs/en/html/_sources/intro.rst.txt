Introduction
============

The *IPv4 Basic Debugging Challenge* is a collection of hypothetical network
problems. The challenge is to narrow the issue down to the root cause while
only having a limited access to the involved network infrastructure.

To improve your network debugging skills you will be able to prove or
to disprove your working hypotheses using a virtual test environment.

For all scenarios a solution including it's approach is provided.

.. warning::
  There is no need to cheat by looking at the solution chapter. The root cause
  analysis in all scenarios can be solved!
